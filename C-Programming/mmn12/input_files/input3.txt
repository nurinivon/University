“Sanctions... on Iran’s energy sector, which include oil and gas, or those on the automotive industry, financial, banking and port sanctions, all should be lifted based on agreements reached so far,” Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi was quoted as saying by Iranian state media.
Araqchi did not say under what mechanism sanctions would be lifted, or refer to how Tehran would meet Washington’s demands and return to its commitments under the deal.
“We will negotiate until the two sides’ positions come closer and our demands are met,” he said. “If they are met there will be an agreement, if not there will naturally be no agreement.”
The US State Department had no immediate comment on Araqchi’s remarks.
US President Joe Biden is seeking to return to the deal after Washington pulled out in 2018 under president Donald Trump and reimposed sanctions against Tehran. Iran responded by breaching many of the deal’s limits on its nuclear activities.

Israel has opposed the revival of the Iran deal and believes that the continuation of the crippling US sanctions the Trump administration imposed on Iran are the best method to prevent Tehran from producing nuclear weapons.
“The Iranian regime will only compromise if it faces determined pressure to do so,” an Israeli official told The Jerusalem Post on Saturday night. “Of course they want the sanctions lifted, and if that happens prematurely, the leverage to get the Iranians to dismantle their nuclear infrastructure will be all but lost.”
Mossad Director Yossi Cohen and National Security Advisor Meir Ben-Shabbat were in Washington last week to discuss regional strategic threats, as well as the dangers of reviving the Iran deal.
According to Israel's Channel 12 news station, Cohen met with Biden in the White House on Friday. He was briefed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prior to the meeting. Members
