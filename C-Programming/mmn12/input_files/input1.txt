Sunday was declared a national day of mourning in Israel following the disaster at Mount Meron in which 45 people were killed on Thursday night after a stampede broke out at the religious bonfire-lighting ceremony for the holiday of Lag Ba'omer.
The proposition to hold a day of mourning was put forward by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Benny Gantz, and confirmed Friday by a vote among the government's ministers held by telephone.
